## Designing and implementing a chip component that selects the desired users.

### Functionality :- 
- [x] When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
- [x] As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
- [x] Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
- [x] Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
- [x] Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
- [x] When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted
